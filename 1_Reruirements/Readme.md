# Introduction

* Electronic circuit evaluator is an application that can assist   engineers in analysing circuit difficulties.
* It used to be a very time-consuming operation for engineers, particularly when working with hardware circuits, to regulate the resistance and voltage across the circuit and maintain the overall resistance and current in balance.
* The overall resistance in the circuit, impedance in RLC, and power computations for the circuit to estimate how long it will work in real world were the key jobs for any electronics technician.
* So, in order to minimize calculating time and make the procedure more automated and error-free, the following system was introduced.
This programme is beneficial to anyone who works with hardware circuits boards. It aids in the determination of resistor values based on colour codes, the determination of system current dependent on series or parallel construction, and the calculation of the circuit's total power.
